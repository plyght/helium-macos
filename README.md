# helium-macos
macOS packaging & development tooling for [Helium](https://github.com/imputnet/helium).

## Building and development
macOS is our primary development platform, so it's the recommended environment for
developing new Helium features.

*[Go to docs/building.md](docs/building.md)*

## Credits
This repo is based on
[ungoogled-chromium-macos](https://github.com/ungoogled-software/ungoogled-chromium-macos),
but heavily modified for Helium. Special thanks to everyone behind ungoogled-chromium,
they made working with Chromium infinitely easier.

A huge thank you to [Depot](https://depot.dev/) for sponsoring our runners, which handle the macOS
builds of Helium. Their high-performance infrastructure lets us compile and package Helium at least
8 times faster than with GitHub-hosted runners, allowing us to release new builds within hours, not days.

## License
All code, patches, modified portions of imported code or patches, and
any other content that is unique to Helium and not imported from other

Any content imported from other projects retains its original license (for
