# helium-macos
macOS development tooling & packaging for [Helium](//github.com/imputnet/helium).

## Credits
This repo is based on
[ungoogled-chromium-macos](https://github.com/ungoogled-software/ungoogled-chromium-macos),
but is pretty heavily modified for Helium. Huge shout-out to everyone behind ungoogled-chromium,
they made working with Chromium infinitely easier.

Big thank you to [Depot](https://depot.dev/) for sponsoring our runners, which handle the macOS
builds of Helium. Their high-performance infrastructure lets us compile and package Helium at least
8 times faster than with GitHub-hosted runners, allowing us to release new builds within hours, not days.
